## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

In the future, I might add:
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown 
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned a lot of new things – it was the largest independent project I’ve completed so far. I’m especially happy with how:

- the visual design turned out
- the site works across different devices
- the weather data search feature came together

Next, I plan to improve the project further by adding functional menus. I’ll probably get to that once I’ve mastered the basics of React.
